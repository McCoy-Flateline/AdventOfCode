## About The Project

Advent of code is a yearly programming puzzle event that is Christmas-themed and follows an Advent calendar release schedule.

This is a place to keep all my attempts at answering the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). These may not be the prettiest bits of code but they are my creations and I am proud of what they have become.
